caaba_2.7b (2010-08-17)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- bugfix for gas_mim1.eqn: mcexp deleted
- reaction rates RR* are already divided by time_step_len in the f90
  code, thus they are not accumulated in the netcdf files anymore

caaba_2.4b (2008-05-29)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- CAABA can now be compiled and run with "OUTPUT = ASCII" in Makefile.
  This is useful to install CAABA on a machine without the netcdf
  library. However, subroutines that read from nc files cannot be used
  in that case, of course.
- messy_main_output renamed to messy_main_mbmio and moved to
  messy/smcl/. The corresponding netcdf and ascii code is contained in
  the include files messy_main_mbmio_ascii.inc and
  messy_main_mbmio_netcdf.inc.
- open_input_file moved from messy_traject_box.f90 to messy_main_mbmio
- close_output_file renamed to close_file because it is also used for
  input files
- messy_semidep_box.f90: different emissions are put into individual
  subsubroutines (emission_default, emission_oomph, ...)
- ncv split into ncv and zipcaaba
- xcaaba: model source code (*.f90, *.inc, *.spc, *.eqn) is also copied
  to output/ after the model run
- xmecca-generated infos are now available as f90 strings in
  messy_mecca_kpp(_global).f90. This works partially also for kp4,
  however, the integrator (integr) is not shown.
- xcaaba lists only the active lines of namelists before running caaba
- template to allow model stop at steady state:
  - FUNCTION steady_state_reached()
  - namelist variable l_steady_state_stop
- messy_mecca_box.f90:

  - if a command line parameter $1 exists, xmecca uses the shell
    variable definitions from batch/$1.bat (instead of interactive mode)
  - header of mecca.eqn now shows infos (e.g. $apn, $rplfile and $wanted)
  - header of kpp-generated *.f90 files shows several infos
- xcaaba:
  - command line parameter $1 is passed to xmecca

  if 'relhum' contains specific humidity, also adjusted in description
  in caaba.nml
- no l_spechum logical in caaba.nml anymore, automatic switch between relhum
  and spechum inside code
- model_start now also in caaba_mem to avoid several times conversion
  from seconds to days and back (e.g., percent_done)
- traject_init has to run before mecca_init so cair is right for chem spec init

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- rosenbrock_posdef.f90 adapted for kpp-2.2.1_rs: IERR_NAMES instead of
  IERR_NAME

- Arrhenius function farr2 renamed to k_arr
- gas.eqn:
  - k_HO2_HO2, k_NO3_NO2, k_BrNO3, k_DMS_OH defined as variables, not

  - elemental function K_3rd used
- aerosol.eqn: temperature dependence in k_arr as REAL, not INTEGER
- xmecca now uses kpp version v1.1-f90-alpha9 and is not compatible with
  older versions of kpp anymore. The main new features of kpp alpha9 are
  the usage of "IMPLICIT NONE" everywhere and the change from "DOUBLE
  PRECISION" to "REAL(dp)" which will improve the forcheck tests. All
  mecca subroutines receive the value of dp via "USE mo_mz_mecca_gdata".
- moved "INTEGER :: jk, jp, jrow" and corresponding USE statements from
  mo_mz_mecca_kpp_mem.f90 to mo_mz_mecca_mem_e5.f90 because of messy structure

- modstr_mecca and modver_mecca are now defined in gas.eqn with
  #INLINE F95_DECL ... #ENDINLINE
  and copied to mo_mz_mecca_gdata.f90 by kpp.
- definition of substeps moved from include/substeps.f90 to gdata module
- xkpp:
  - also works for scav_cloud
  - xkpp: calls decomp/xdecomp if the user wants to remove indirect
    indexing (preliminary). All scripts and temporary files from BS are
    now in decomp/ subdirectory. xdecomp calls seddecomp_ros*
  - xkpp: default integrator = ros3
  - xkpp: bug fixed (confusion between sulfur "S" and stratospheric "St"
    reactions)

CHANGES by Benedikt Steil:
- Several scripts decomp/seddecomp_ros* to remove indirect indexing
  (preliminary).

CHANGES by Astrid Kerkweg:
- label Mbl included in xkpp and aerosol.eqn file

******************************************************************************

mecca_07 (2003-07-04)

- mecca.spc divided into gas.spc and aerosol.spc

- all species defined as VARIABLES

- some species changed to FIXED in mecca.k

- constants changed from 1d0 to 1E0 etc.

******************************************************************************

mecca_06 (2003-06-23)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- driver.f90 is now a dummy file. The contents of it has been moved to
  mo_mz_mecca_e5.f90.
- new awk script tracdef.awk extracts all KPP_XXX from
  mo_mz_kpp_gdata.f90 and inserts these species into mz_idt.f90. For all
  KPP_XXX that are not zero it also inserts the species into
  mz_conc2mr.f90, mz_mr2conc.f90, and mz_trac.f90, using the tracer info
  in tracdef.tex. xkpp starts tracdef.awk and then moves the new files
  to the include/ directory.
- aerosol.eqn: temp is now a parameter of farr2()
- gas.eqn:
  - Khet() is now a 4-d array
  - new filenames for USE statements: e.g. mo_mz_mecca_kpp_mem
- xkpp: radau5 added; using kpp version v1.1-f90-devel now

******************************************************************************

mecca_05 (2003-05-22)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- halogen and aerosol chemistry added (gas.eqn and aerosol.eqn)
- xkpp: 
  - some info about the selection etc. added to beginning of mo_mz_kpp.f90
  - mecca.eqn is added to mo_mz_kpp.f90
- using kpp version v1.1-f90-alpha6 now
- mecca-all.eqn renamed to gas.eqn

******************************************************************************

mecca_04 (2002-12-23)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- this version was used for echam5.1.04_mz03
- kpp now gets information about rate constants from kpp_interface
- additional submodels only need to add one line to #INLINE F95_RCONST, e.g.:
  USE mo_mz_modstr_kpp_interface

******************************************************************************

mecca_03 (2002-11-25)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- this version was used for echam5.1.04_mz02i
- new shell script xkpp that selects wanted reactions and runs kpp
- correct labels {%...} added to mecca-all.eqn
- gas-phase reaction N2O5 + H2O deactivated
- CH3O replaced  with HCHO + HO2
- products O2, N2, and CO2 deleted because they are fixed species
- heterogeneous chemistry from smeili
- reaction numbers (not yet for halogen reactions)
- updated rate constant for N2+O1D and for CO+OH

- note added on 2010-03-17: gas.eqn was updated in this version,
  probably with new MIM chemistry from RvK. For example, the coefficient
  for ACETOL + hv was changed from 0.11 to 0.074

******************************************************************************

mecca_02 (2002-11-12)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- upgrade to kpp version 1.1-f90-alpha5:
  - indices kpp_* for array C() are defined (independent of NVARST etc.)
  - unused kpp dummy species get a value of kpp_* = 0
  - i_* should not be used anymore
- rate constants updated with mecca-all-psc.eqn from smeili (original
  psc eqn files are also included in mecca_02.zip)

******************************************************************************

mecca_01 (2002-11-04)

CHANGES by Rolf Sander:
- produces exactly the files mo_mz_kpp*.f90 as they are included in
  echam5.1.04_mz02
- needs kpp version 1.1-f90-alpha
