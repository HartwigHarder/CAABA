OVERVIEW

ncclamp is a command-line tool for NetCDF files that allows you to replace values in-place by specifying the variable, the old value to be replaced, the new value, and a comparison operator.  The change is applied across all of the variable's dimensions, including the record dimension if any.  

=====================================================

EXAMPLES

The following example would mask a variable "topography" to be Not-a-Number every below sea level.

	ncclamp foo.nc topography 0 nan lt

This example would replace a value with -infinity.

	ncclamp foo.nc var1 -1e9 -inf eq

This would create a binary mask of a variable.

	ncclamp foo.nc veg -9999 0 eq
	ncclamp foo.nc veg 0 1 neq

=====================================================

INSTALLATION

To build and install, do the following:

	make
	make test	
	cp ncclamp /usr/local/bin
	make clean
